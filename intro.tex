\subsection{Information about authors}
Please place last name after first name, declare them completely. If all the authors work in one place, their names are written with a comma (after last's no comma) in a single column. So a number of columns are equal to number of authors working in different places. Following declare author's place of work (at new line, no comma in the end). Place of work it's only general name of company or university, without name of particular department. On the new line place city and country by comma, and on the last line -- email (without word ``Email'', don't use hyperlinks). The sequence of authors -- at your discretion. The order of publication in Proceedings is defined by the first author. Your can see different ways to design information about authors at Fig. \ref{fig1}.
