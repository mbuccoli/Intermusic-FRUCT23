With the big improvement of digital communication networks, Networked Music Performances (NMP) received a great interest from music live performance and music recording industry. The positive impact of NMP in pedagogical applications, instead, has been only preliminary explored. Within the InterMUSIC project, we aim to investigate NMP from a pedagogical perspective, that has considerable differences with respect to music performances, and to develop tools to improve distance learning experiences. In this paper, we introduce a conceptual framework designed to be the foundation for all the experiments conducted in the project. We also present two preliminary experiments that investigate the sense of presence of geographically-distant musicians in a distance learning scenario. We discuss the comments provided by the musicians as a set of requirements and guidelines for future experiments.
