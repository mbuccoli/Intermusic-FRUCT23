With the big improvement of digital communication networks, Networked Music Performances (NMP) received a great interest from music live performance e music recording industry. The positive impact of NMP in pedagogical applications, instead, it has been only preliminary explored. Within the InterMUSIC project, we aim to investigate NMP from a pedagogical perspective, that has considerable differences with respect to music performances, and to develop tools to improve distance learning experiences. In this paper, we introduce a conceptual framework designed to be the foundaments for all the experiments conducted in the project. We also present two preliminary experiments that investigates on the sense presence of geographically-distant musicians in distance learning scenario. We discuss the comments provided by the musicians as a set of requirements and guidelines for future experiments.
