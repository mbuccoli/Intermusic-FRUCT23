Using Networked Music Performances for pedagogical scenarios require a deep investigation on the topic to find metrics, factors and aspects that may help musicians to improve their musical skills.

In this paper, we presented a framework for conducting perceptual experiments to continue this investigation for the purposes of the project InterMUSIC. We then discussed two experiments conducted using the framework and the preliminary results that we observed.

Starting from this results, we described the areas of investigation that we intend to conduct for the project, with the final goal of developing a platform for NMPs in pedagogical scenarios that also work with general-purpose hardware.

Beyond this areas, in future work we intend to further develop the formalization of the framework into an ontology, which will be integrated in the NMP tools, in order to collect and analyze a number of semantically-annotated rehearsal or lessons \cite{Kolazi2013}.
