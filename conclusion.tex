This part presents the key findings in substance. Avoid simple enumeration of the following material. It is desirable to provide a link to existing articles and grants. 

%In this paper we use the description of the framework as an abstraction of the perceptual experiments we have conducted and of the aspects of NMPs we aim to investigate. Moreover, we intend to further develop this formalization into an ontology, which will be integrated in the NMP tools, in order to collect and analyze a number of semantically-annotated rehearsal or lessons.
